# Plus-minus

A little Vue.js project/experiment.

Outsource ‘remembering the number’... so my girlfriend can focus on what matters most. That is recreating Star Wars crochet figures. Ironic, because the design is based on interfaces of Star Trek.

Even after you refreshed the page, the number will still be there. Other features include negative numbers, resetting to zero by holding the minus button and it kinda acts like a (web) app: open [the website](https://mellewynia.github.io/plus-minus/) and ‘pin to homescreen’ (iOS).
